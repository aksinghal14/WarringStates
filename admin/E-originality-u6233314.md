I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage E of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the
following documented exceptions:
* The idea of Testing code came from the lecture and the Test code(i.e. GetSupportersTest)
* The code in class <updatePlacementTest><getCardTest><SortCardTest> uses an idea suggested by <TestUtility>
