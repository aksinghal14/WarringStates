Review Comments:

1. her best features is divide all the functions to different functions, so that we can use these functions later
2. it may lack of explanation, but we know that when we had meeting weekly.
3. it has a good structure, for example, she created two very useful functions: getLine() and isInSameLine()
4. it follow Java code conventions, and the style is consistent.
