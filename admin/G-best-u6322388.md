I submit the following for assessment as my best designs and class.

* The refresh button with compilation in game.jar.
* Changing colors of the text
* Making kingdoms without getting help from the assets
* A sound file playing at the starting of the game
* getCardPlacement() in Task 2

I declare that this is entirely my own work
